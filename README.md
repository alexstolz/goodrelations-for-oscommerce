## A GoodRelations Ontology Extension for the OS E-commerce Solution osCommerce ##

This project aims at improving OS Web shop and CMS software (in this particular case osCommerce) by extending them with capabilities for the Semantic Web. 

The ontology [GoodRelations](http://www.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/), a standard vocabulary for e-commerce and complementing eClassOWL, is used to describe products and services offerings and their relationships to other resources in a machine-readable format.

By issuing e-commerce applications with the GoodRelations ontology, powerful tools to annotate products and services offerings on the Web can emerge. To help avoiding duplicate output of data in Web pages, the systems support besides RDF/XML dump output also RDFa, which enables to embed interchangeable formats as metadata in a set of XHTML attributes.

Tested with !osCommerce Online Merchant v2.2 RC 2a.

There exists also a release for VirtueMart / Joomla! at http://code.google.com/p/goodrelations-for-joomla/
